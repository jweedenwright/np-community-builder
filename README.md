# Non-Profit Community Builder

The purpose of this software is to build an easy to operate and manage software solution for tracking volunteer information as well as other important metrics.

The tracking of these metrics are essential, as well as the built in dashboard, for helping non-profits to show the impact they have within the community.

## Getting Started

This documentation is to help setup the non-profit community builder application using the code in this package.

### Prerequisites

This software solution was originally built on the Microsoft Axure cloud. The application requires:
* A PHP install (at least 5.6.7)
* Email support on your PHP server
* SQL Server

### Setting Up A User
To setup a user in the system:
1. You will need a database admin to add the email address to the database
2. Once the email address is there, you'll need to go to the /pages/login.php page and choose 'Reset Password'
3. After recieving the password reset email, you'll need to follow the link
4. Reset your password on that page and you'll be set.
